# portainer_templates
A list of templates used by the Coyotech Portainer server!

##TODO:
1) Reminder: Be prepared to reformat portainer.json. When Portainer CE 2.1 comes out with support for Docker-compose v3, things will most certainly change.
2) Docker-compose files are NOT complete.
  a) Remember to find a way to replace volumes with "anonymous" volumes to allow for multiple stacks of the same container, but provide different data volumes.
  b) Read A. Make random generated volume names. This might not be an issue if CE 2.1 has good support options for v3 compose.
